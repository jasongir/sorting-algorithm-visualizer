# The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

<!-- What was your motivation, why did you build this project, what problem does it solve, what did you learn, what makes this stand out/features section -->

Welcome to the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer! This React.js web app allows you to visualize the steps of some of the most famous sorts, including bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, shell sort, merge sort, and quick sort. You can easily see, step by step, how these algorithms sort arrays of numbers ranging from 1 to 100. You can also import your own data or customize random data to see how these algorithms work for different data sets.

Visit the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer at [https://sorting-algo-viz.netlify.app/](https://sorting-algo-viz.netlify.app/)

## Features

* Input your own comma-separated list of numbers to be sorted
* Or create randomized data based upon your parameters (array size, minimum value, maximum value)
* Play sorts at speeds ranging from 30 milliseconds to 1 second
* Further adjust speed with speed adjustment menu under the scroll bar
* Quickly scroll through sort by using the bottom scroll bar
* Or move frame-by-frame by clicking the forwards and backwards buttons under the scroll bar
* Use keyboard controls to navigate through the sorting (space to pause, left and right arrows to move frame-by-frame)

## Technologies
* This project is primarily built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
  * The entire project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
  *  This app uses exclusively functional components and makes extensive use of React hooks such as useEffect, useState, and useRef.
* This site was styled using vanilla CSS and [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/), which provided pre-built components for layout, inputs, and navigation.
  * Client-side routing for this application used [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)'s react-router-dom library.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
